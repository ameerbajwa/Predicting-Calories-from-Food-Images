# Predicting-Calories-from-Food-Images
#### Project to see if whether a model can successfully predict the number of calories of a food item based just on it's appearance or image.
#### Here, I use a pretrained deep learning model called VGG16 and further train it on different food images.
#### Then, I use supervised learning on the predicted features of calorie-labeled food images to predict the calorie count.
